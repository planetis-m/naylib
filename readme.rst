Usage Tips
==========

Choosing the OpenGL Graphics Backend Version
--------------------------------------------

To choose a version of the OpenGL graphics backend on desktop, select one of the following options:

- ``-d:GraphicsApiOpenGl43`` (OpenGL 4.3)
- ``-d:GraphicsApiOpenGl33`` (OpenGL 3.3 - default)
- ``-d:GraphicsApiOpenGl21`` (OpenGL 2.1)
- ``-d:GraphicsApiOpenGl11`` (OpenGL 1.1)
- ``-d:GraphicsApiOpenGlEs2`` (OpenGL ES 2.0)
- ``-d:GraphicsApiOpenGlEs3`` (OpenGL ES 3.0)

Note: By default, Naylib will use OpenGL 3.3 on desktop platforms.

If you're compiling on Linux for Wayland, add the ``-d:wayland`` flag.

Building for the Web
--------------------

To compile your code to run on the web using WebAssembly, you will need to define
``emscripten``. Additionally, you will need to create a configuration file. You can find an
example configuration file at
https://github.com/planetis-m/raylib-examples/blob/main/core/basic_window_web.nims.

Building for Android
--------------------

Building your raylib project for Android is a bit different than building for desktop.
Here are the steps you need to follow:

**1. Install OpenJDK, Android SDK and Android NDK by following the instructions on the official raylib wiki:**

You can find instructions on how to install OpenJDK, Android SDK, and Android NDK on the official raylib wiki. Here are the links to the instructions for different platforms:

- `Working for Android <https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-for-Android>`_
- `Working for Android (on Linux) <https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-for-Android-(on-Linux)>`_
- `Working for Android (on macOS) <https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-for-Android-(on-macOS)>`_

Note that you can use the latest versions of the software. Alternatively, on Arch Linux,
you can install the following AUR packages instead:
``android-sdk android-sdk-build-tools android-sdk-platform-tools android-ndk android-platform(-33)``.

**2. Fork the** `planetis-m/raylib-game-template <https://github.com/planetis-m/raylib-game-template>`_ **repository.**

The `build_android.nims <https://github.com/planetis-m/raylib-game-template/blob/master/build_android.nims#L22-L55>`_
file allows you to specify the locations of the OpenJDK, Android SDK, NDK on your computer
by setting variables in the file. It also contains several configuration options that can
be customized to suit your needs, such as the application name and icon or the architecture of
the device you are targeting.

**3. Run the following commands to setup and then build the project for Android:**

Use the following command to set up and build the project for Android:

.. code-block:: bash

  nimble setupAndroid
  nimble buildAndroid

If everything goes smoothly, you will see a file named raylib_game.apk in the same directory.

For a step-by-step video tutorial on getting started with naylib for Android, you can also watch
`this <https://youtu.be/fDIKu_kBa78>`_

**4. Install and run the APK on your Android device.**

Enable USB Debugging on your Android device, plug it into your computer, select File Transfer,
accept the RSA key and install the package with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  adb -d install raylib_game.apk

Now you should be able to run your raylib game on your Android device!

Define a PixelFormat for your custom type
-----------------------------------------

To make your external type compatible with the ``Pixel`` concept, you need to define a
template named ``kind`` that returns the corresponding pixel format for your external type.

For example, if you have a type called ``RGBAPixel`` that represents a 32-bit color value,
you can write:

.. code-block:: nim

  from raylib import PixelFormat

  type RGBAPixel* = distinct byte

  template kind*(x: typedesc[RGBAPixel]): PixelFormat = UncompressedR8g8b8a8

This way, you can use ``RGBAPixel`` as a ``Pixel`` in your code.

How to properly call closeWindow
--------------------------------

While types in Naylib are wrapped with Nim's destructors, ``closeWindow`` needs to be
called at the very end of the program. However, this can cause conflicts with variables
that are destroyed after the last statement in your program.

To avoid these conflicts, you can use one of the following methods:

- Use the ``defer`` statement (which is not available at the top level) or the ``try-finally`` block.

.. code-block:: nim

  initWindow(800, 450, "example")
  defer: closeWindow()
  let texture = loadTexture("resources/example.png")

- Wrap everything inside a game object.

.. code-block:: nim

  type
    Game = object

  proc `=destroy`(x: Game) =
    assert isWindowReady(), "Window is already closed"
    closeWindow()

  proc `=sink`(x: var Game; y: Game) {.error.}
  proc `=dup`(y: Game): Game {.error.}
  proc `=copy`(x: var Game; y: Game) {.error.}
  proc `=wasMoved`(x: var Game) {.error.}

  proc initGame(width, height, fps: int32, flags: Flags[ConfigFlags], title: string): Game =
    assert not isWindowReady(), "Window is already opened"
    setConfigFlags(flags)
    initWindow(width, height, title)
    setTargetFPS(fps)

  proc gameShouldClose(x: Game): bool {.inline.} =
    result = windowShouldClose()

  let game = initGame(800, 450, 60, flags(Msaa4xHint, WindowHighdpi), "example")
  let texture = loadTexture("resources/example.png")

- Open a new scope

.. code-block:: nim

  initWindow(800, 450, "example")
  block:
    let texture = loadTexture("resources/example.png")
  closeWindow()


Raylib functions to Nim
-----------------------

While most of raylib functions are wrapped in Naylib, some functions are not wrapped
because they closely reflect the C API and are considered less idiomatic or harder to use.
Here is a `table <alternatives_table.rst>`_ that provides their equivalent Nim functions.

Swapping out Raymath
--------------------

Raylib is designed to be independent of ``raymath``, and it's important to maintain this
separation. This allows you to swap out ``raymath`` for another vector math library that
is available through nimble, including options like ``vmath``, ``geometrymath``, or ``glm``.

However, it's worth noting that if you do decide to switch to a different library, you'll
need to have converters in place for ``Vector2``, ``Vector3``, ``Vector4``, ``Matrix``,
and their respective counterparts. Here's an example of how you can implement these
converters:

.. code-block:: nim

  static:
    assert sizeof(raylib.Vector2) == sizeof(geometrymath.Vector2[float32])

  converter toVector2*(x: geometrymath.Vector2[float32]): raylib.Vector2 {.inline.} =
    cast[raylib.Vector2](x)

  converter fromVector2*(x: raylib.Vector2): geometrymath.Vector2[float32] {.inline.} =
    cast[geometrymath.Vector2[float32]](x)

Overview of Changes
===================

Memory Management of Raylib Types using Destructors
---------------------------------------------------

In Naylib, types such as ``Image`` and ``Wave`` utilize destructors for memory management.
This approach not only eliminates the need for manual ``Unload`` calls but also offers other
benefits, including more reliable and safer memory management, reduced code complexity,
and easier maintenance.

Change in Naming Convention
---------------------------

In raylib, various functions have similar names that differ in suffixes based on the type
of arguments they receive. For instance, functions like ``DrawRectangle``,
``DrawRectangleV``, ``DrawRectangleRec``, and ``DrawRectanglePro`` vary in their suffixes.
However, in Naylib, this naming convention has changed. Functions that return ``Vector2``
or ``Rectangle`` still follow the previous naming convention, but function overloading is
now used for cases that previously employed different suffixes. This allows for a more
uniform and intuitive naming convention.

Encapsulation and Safe API for Pointers to Arrays of Structures
---------------------------------------------------------------

Data types that hold pointers to arrays of structures, such as ``Model``, are encapsulated
and offer index operators to provide a safe and idiomatic API. As an example, the code
snippet ``model.materials[0].maps[MaterialMapIndex.Diffuse].texture = texture`` includes a
runtime bounds check on the index to ensure safe access to the data.

Mapping of C Enums to Nim
-------------------------

The C enums have been mapped to Nim, and their values have been shortened by removing
their prefix. For instance, ``LOG_TRACE`` is represented as ``Trace``.

Type Checking for Enums
-----------------------

Each function argument, array index or object field that is intended to employ a
particular enum type undergoes type checking. Consequently, erroneous code such as
``isKeyPressed(MouseButton.Left)`` fails to compile.

Abstraction of Raw Pointers and CString Parameters
--------------------------------------------------

To improve the safety and usability of the public API, Naylib has abstracted the use of
raw pointers through the use of ``openArray[T]``, with the exception of ``cstring``
parameters, which are automatically converted from ``string``. If you encounter a warning
related to ``CStringConv``, you can silence it by using the ``--warning:CStringConv:off``
flag.

Safer Begin-End Pairs with Syntactic Sugar
------------------------------------------

To enhance the usability of begin-end pairs like ``beginDrawing`` and ``endDrawing`` in
naylib, additional syntactic sugar has been introduced in the form of templates such as
``drawing`` and ``mode3D``. These templates can accept a block of code and offer added
safety measures in case of any errors. As a result, even if an error occurs, the program
will not be left in an invalid state, as the "end" part will always be executed.

Addition of RArray Type
-----------------------

The ``RArray[T]`` type has been added to encapsulate memory managed by raylib. It provides
index operators, len, and ``@`` (which converts to ``seq``) and ``toOpenArray``. You can use
this type to work with raylib functions that manage memory without needing to make copies.

Working with Bitflags in Nim
----------------------------

Raylib uses bitflags for ``ConfigFlags`` and ``Gesture``. To work with these flags in Nim,
you can use the ``flags`` procedure which returns ``Flags[T]``. An example of this would
be ``flags(Msaa4xHint, WindowHighdpi)``.

Change in Dropped Files Functions
---------------------------------

In raylib 4.2, the functions ``LoadDroppedFiles`` and ``UnloadDroppedFiles`` were
introduced but were later removed. Instead, the older function ``getDroppedFiles`` was
reintroduced as it is more efficient and easier to wrap, requiring fewer copies.

Using Embedded Images and Waves in Naylib
-----------------------------------------

Use the ``toWeak*`` procs to get an ``WeakImage`` or ``WeakWave``, which are
not memory managed and can be embedded directly into source code. To use this feature,
first export the image or wave as code using the ``exportImageAsCode`` or
``exportWaveAsCode`` procs, and then translate the output to Nim using a tool such as
``c2nim`` or by manual conversion. An example of how to use this feature can be found in
the example ``others/embedded_files_loading.nim`` which is available at
https://github.com/planetis-m/raylib-examples/blob/main/others/embedded_files_loading.nim.

Integration of External Data Types with ShaderV and Pixel
---------------------------------------------------------

The concepts of ``ShaderV`` and ``Pixel`` permit the integration of external data types
into procs that employ them, such as ``setShaderValue`` and ``updateTexture``.

Using IsReady() in Asset Loading
--------------------------------

To prevent unexpected behavior or crashes, ``Load()`` functions utilize ``IsReady()`` to confirm
asset loading success and raise ``RaylibError`` if an asset is not found. This approach
ensures that the program not only logs an error but also immediately takes action to
handle it appropriately.

Math Libraries
--------------

In addition to porting the ``raymath`` and ``reasings`` libraries to Nim, Naylib also
provides math operators like ``+``, ``*``, ``-=`` for convenience.
