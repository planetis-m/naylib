Welcome to this repository! Here you'll find a Nim wrapper for raylib, a library for
creating 2D and 3D games. The Nim API is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use.

## Features

- **Easy-to-use API**: Simplified Nim interface for raylib functions
- **Cross-platform support**: Develop for multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, macOS, Web and Android
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Detailed guides and API references
- **Active community**: Get support and share your creations

## Documentation

To learn more about how to use this wrapper, you can check out the documentation:

- [raylib](https://planetis-m.github.io/naylib/raylib.html) - Core library for videogame programming
- [raymath](https://planetis-m.github.io/naylib/raymath.html) - Mathematical functions for game development
- [rlgl](https://planetis-m.github.io/naylib/rlgl.html) - Abstraction layer for OpenGL with immediate-mode API
- [reasings](https://planetis-m.github.io/naylib/reasings.html) - Smooth animation transitions
- [rmem](https://planetis-m.github.io/naylib/rmem.html) - Memory pool and objects pool allocators

If you're familiar with the C version of raylib, you may find the
[cheatsheet](https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html) useful.

## Installation

Install naylib easily with `nimble install naylib`.

For Linux users only: Ensure you have the [required](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux)
dependencies installed using your distribution's native package manager.

## Examples

We've also provided some example code to help you get started. You can find it in the
accompanying [example repository](https://github.com/planetis-m/raylib-examples).
To compile and run an example: `nim c -r -d:release example.nim`
